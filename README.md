# CraftSync
A back-end for your Minecraft Server written in TypeScript.

## Description
<p>CraftSync does all the database heavy-lifting behind the scenes so that your Minecraft Server can run smoothly.</p>

## Compatible Databases (More Coming Soon)
- Postgres

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

## Java-HTTP
All though there are many ways to make HTTP requests in Java, I recommend using [this](https://github.com/Kong/unirest-java).
